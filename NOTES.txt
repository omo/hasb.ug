  - The shortening entry has a shortening pattern and visibility.
  - THe shortening entry can be edited.

Linker:

Vague ideas:

- Prefixed shortener like wk12345

- API

Some ideas:
---------------------------------------------

 - Having CLI tool for operating models.
   - Adding user (possible?)
   - Adding shortenings.
   - ...

- named http://jquery.hasb.ug/chromespecific
  No auth

- named meta http://jquery.hasb.ug/+chromespecific

- title for bug http://jquery.hasb.ug/12345/title
  Do we need this?

        http://hasb.ug/~omo/b
        http://hasb.ug/~omo/b/...?

. user bug: http://omo.hasb.ug/ (don't need nothing special.)
